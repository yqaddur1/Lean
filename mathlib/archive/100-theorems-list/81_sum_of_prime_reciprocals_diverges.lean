# Divergence of the Prime Reciprocal Series

This file proves Theorem 81 from the [100 Theorems List](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/).
The theorem states that the sum of the reciprocals of all prime numbers diverges.
The formalization follows Erdős's proof by upper and lower estimates.

## Proof outline

1. Assume that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes converges.
2. Then there exists a `k : ℕ` such that, for any `x : ℕ`, the sum of the reciprocals of the primes
   between `k` and `x + 1` is less than 1/2 (`sum_lt_half_of_not_tendsto`).
3. For any `x : ℕ`, we can partition `range x` into two subsets (`range_sdiff_eq_bUnion`):
    * `M x k`, the subset of those `e` for which `e + 1` is a product of powers of primes smaller
      than or equal to `k`;
    * `U x k`, the subset of those `e` for which there is a prime `p > k` that divides `e + 1`.
4. Then `|U x k|` is bounded by the sum over the primes `p > k` of the number of multiples of `p`
   in `(k, x]`, which is at most `x / p`. It follows that `|U x k|` is at most `x` times the sum of
  the reciprocals of the primes between `k` and `x + 1`, which is less than 1/2 as noted in (2), so
  `|U x k| < x / 2` (`card_le_mul_sum`).
5. By factoring `e + 1 = (m + 1)² * (r + 1)`, `r + 1` squarefree and `m + 1 ≤ √x`, and noting that
   squarefree numbers correspond to subsets of `[1, k]`, we find that `|M x k| ≤ 2 ^ k * √x`
   (`card_le_two_pow_mul_sqrt`).
6. Finally, setting `x := (2 ^ (k + 1))²` (`√x = 2 ^ (k + 1)`), we find that
   `|M x k| ≤ 2 ^ k * 2 ^ (k + 1) = x / 2`. Combined with the strict bound for `|U k x|` from (4),
   `x = |M x k| + |U x k| < x / 2 + x / 2 = x`.

If the sum of the reciprocals of the primes converges, there exists a `k : ℕ` such that the sum of
the reciprocals of the primes greater than `k` is less than 1/2.

More precisely, for any `x : ℕ`, the sum of the reciprocals of the primes between `k` and `x + 1`
