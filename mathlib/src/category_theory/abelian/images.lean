# The abelian image and coimage.

In an abelian category we usually want the image of a morphism `f` to be defined as
`kernel (cokernel.π f)`, and the coimage to be defined as `cokernel (kernel.ι f)`.

We make these definitions here, as `abelian.image f` and `abelian.coimage f`
(without assuming the category is actually abelian),
and later relate these to the usual categorical notions when in an abelian category.

There is a canonical morphism `coimage_image_comparison : abelian.coimage f ⟶ abelian.image f`.
Later we show that this is always an isomorphism in an abelian category,
and conversely a category with (co)kernels and finite products in which this morphism
is always an isomorphism is an abelian category.

/--
The canonical map from the abelian coimage to the abelian image.
In any abelian category this is an isomorphism.

Conversely, any additive category with kernels and cokernels and
in which this is always an isomorphism, is abelian.
