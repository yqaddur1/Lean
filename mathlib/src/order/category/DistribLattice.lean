# The category of distributive lattices

This file defines `DistribLattice`, the category of distributive lattices.

Note that [`DistLat`](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/DistLat) in the literature doesn't always
correspond to `DistribLattice` as we don't require bottom or top elements. Instead, this `DistLat`
corresponds to `BoundedDistribLattice`.
