# Symmetric difference

The symmetric difference or disjunctive union of sets `A` and `B` is the set of elements that are
in either `A` or `B` but not both. Translated into propositions, the symmetric difference is `xor`.

The symmetric difference operator (`symm_diff`) is defined in this file for any type with `⊔` and
`\` via the formula `(A \ B) ⊔ (B \ A)`, however the theorems proved about it only hold for
`generalized_boolean_algebra`s and `boolean_algebra`s.

The symmetric difference is the addition operator in the Boolean ring structure on Boolean algebras.

## Main declarations

* `symm_diff`: the symmetric difference operator, defined as `(A \ B) ⊔ (B \ A)`

In generalized Boolean algebras, the symmetric difference operator is:

* `symm_diff_comm`: commutative, and
* `symm_diff_assoc`: associative.

## Notations

* `a ∆ b`: `symm_diff a b`

## References

The proof of associativity follows the note "Associativity of the Symmetric Difference of Sets: A
Proof from the Book" by John McCuan:

* <https://people.math.gatech.edu/~mccuan/courses/4317/symmetricdifference.pdf>
