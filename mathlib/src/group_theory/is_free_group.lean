# Free groups structures on arbitrary types

This file defines a type class for type that are free groups, together with the usual operations.
The type class can be instantiated by providing an isomorphim to the canonical free group, or by
proving that the universal property holds.

For the explicit construction of free groups, see `group_theory/free_group`.

## Main definitions

* `is_free_group G` - a typeclass to indicate that `G` is free over some generators
* `is_free_group.of` - the canonical injection of `G`'s generators into `G`
* `is_free_group.lift` - the universal property of the free group

## Main results

* `is_free_group.to_free_group` - any free group with generators `A` is equivalent to
  `free_group A`.
* `is_free_group.unique_lift` - the universal property of a free group
* `is_free_group.of_unique_lift` - constructing `is_free_group` from the universal property
