# Subsemigroups: definition and `complete_lattice` structure

This file defines bundled multiplicative and additive subsemigroups. We also define
a `complete_lattice` structure on `subsemigroup`s,
and define the closure of a set as the minimal subsemigroup that includes this set.

## Main definitions

* `subsemigroup M`: the type of bundled subsemigroup of a magma `M`; the underlying set is given in
  the `carrier` field of the structure, and should be accessed through coercion as in `(S : set M)`.
* `add_subsemigroup M` : the type of bundled subsemigroups of an additive magma `M`.

For each of the following definitions in the `subsemigroup` namespace, there is a corresponding
definition in the `add_subsemigroup` namespace.

* `subsemigroup.copy` : copy of a subsemigroup with `carrier` replaced by a set that is equal but
  possibly not definitionally equal to the carrier of the original `subsemigroup`.
* `subsemigroup.closure` :  semigroup closure of a set, i.e.,
  the least subsemigroup that includes the set.
* `subsemigroup.gi` : `closure : set M → subsemigroup M` and coercion `coe : subsemigroup M → set M`
  form a `galois_insertion`;

## Implementation notes

Subsemigroup inclusion is denoted `≤` rather than `⊆`, although `∈` is defined as
membership of a subsemigroup's underlying set.

Note that `subsemigroup M` does not actually require `semigroup M`,
instead requiring only the weaker `has_mul M`.

This file is designed to have very few dependencies. In particular, it should not use natural
numbers.
