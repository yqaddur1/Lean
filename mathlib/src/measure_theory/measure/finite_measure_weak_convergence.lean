# Weak convergence of (finite) measures

This file defines the topology of weak convergence of finite measures and probability measures
on topological spaces. The topology of weak convergence is the coarsest topology w.r.t. which
for every bounded continuous `ℝ≥0`-valued function `f`, the integration of `f` against the
measure is continuous.

TODOs:
* Prove that an equivalent definition of the topologies is obtained requiring continuity of
  integration of bounded continuous `ℝ`-valued functions instead.
* Include the portmanteau theorem on characterizations of weak convergence of (Borel) probability
  measures.

## Main definitions

The main definitions are the
 * types `finite_measure α` and `probability_measure α` with topologies of weak convergence;
 * `to_weak_dual_bcnn : finite_measure α → (weak_dual ℝ≥0 (α →ᵇ ℝ≥0))`
   allowing to interpret a finite measure as a continuous linear functional on the space of
   bounded continuous nonnegative functions on `α`. This is used for the definition of the
   topology of weak convergence.

## Main results

 * Finite measures `μ` on `α` give rise to continuous linear functionals on the space of
   bounded continuous nonnegative functions on `α` via integration:
   `to_weak_dual_bcnn : finite_measure α → (weak_dual ℝ≥0 (α →ᵇ ℝ≥0))`.
 * `tendsto_iff_forall_lintegral_tendsto`: Convergence of finite measures and probability measures
   is characterized by the convergence of integrals of all bounded continuous (nonnegative)
   functions. This essentially shows that the given definition of topology corresponds to the
   common textbook definition of weak convergence of measures.

TODO:
* Portmanteau theorem.

## Notations

No new notation is introduced.

## Implementation notes

The topology of weak convergence of finite Borel measures will be defined using a mapping from
`finite_measure α` to `weak_dual ℝ≥0 (α →ᵇ ℝ≥0)`, inheriting the topology from the latter.

The current implementation of `finite_measure α` and `probability_measure α` is directly as
subtypes of `measure α`, and the coercion to a function is the composition `ennreal.to_nnreal`
and the coercion to function of `measure α`. Another alternative would be to use a bijection
with `vector_measure α ℝ≥0` as an intermediate step. The choice of implementation should not have
drastic downstream effects, so it can be changed later if appropriate.

Potential advantages of using the `nnreal`-valued vector measure alternative:
 * The coercion to function would avoid need to compose with `ennreal.to_nnreal`, the
   `nnreal`-valued API could be more directly available.
Potential drawbacks of the vector measure alternative:
 * The coercion to function would lose monotonicity, as non-measurable sets would be defined to
   have measure 0.
 * No integration theory directly. E.g., the topology definition requires `lintegral` w.r.t.
   a coercion to `measure α` in any case.
